                      The Camel and The Jackal

Let us enjoy reading this story of The Camel and The Jackal. 

A camel and a jackal were friends. One day the jackal took his friend to a big sugar-cane farm. 

It was on the opposite side of a river. After a sumptuous meal the jackal began to howl loudly. 

The frightened camel pleaded with the jackal not to do so. The jackal said, "Friend, 

I have this habit after every meal. 

I cannot help it." Soon the farmers arrived and gave a sound thrashing to the camel. 

When the camel crossed the river the jackal joined him on his back. 

In the midstream the camel took a deliberate dip in the water. 

When the jackal cried out in terror, the camel said casually: 

"I have the habit of rolling in the water after every meal." 

The poor jackal was drowned.
